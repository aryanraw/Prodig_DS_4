# Prodigy Data Science Internship Task 4

This repository contains the code for Task 4 of the Prodigy Data Science Internship. Task 4 involves analyzing the Titanic dataset and visualizing various aspects of it using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Task Description
"Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands"

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

## Code Overview
- **Importing Libraries:** Importing necessary libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Loading Dataset:** Loading the Titanic dataset using Pandas.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values in the dataset by dropping rows with missing values for the "Embarked" column and filling missing values in the "Cabin" and "Age" columns.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Performing EDA by visualizing the distribution of passenger ages, passenger class distribution, age distribution by passenger class, survival by gender, and a scatter plot of age vs fare colored by survival status.

## Repository Structure
- `titanic.csv`: Dataset containing information about passengers aboard the Titanic.
- `task_4_code.py`: Python script containing the code for Task 4.
